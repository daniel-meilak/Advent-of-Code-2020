## Day 3

A periodic system; this reminds me strongly of the computational physics classes I helped teach a couple years ago where students were faced with many different periodic systems. Luckily, today's problem only requires a little work, using a modulo operator to move from one side of the map to the other. 

I think this is the first function I've written for AoC 2020, not that I have any trouble with this but it is going to be a struggle to figure out how much I want to generalise code and how much I'll allow myself to wing it. I think in general I'll try to only use functions if I am clearly repeating the same code over and over and if it's more effort not to. 

Part 2 was easy to solve as my part 1 solution already accounted for variable rise/run values.

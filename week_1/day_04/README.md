## Day 4

I don't think I've ever used more return statements in a single function before. I can almost hear the tut-tuts. Well in this case I think it worked very well as the functions are pretty clear to go over (not to mention the over commenting). While I could have used a boolean to return true or false, I am saving a few extra steps in each function anyway. 

Whatever I tell myself to sleep better at night I suppose.

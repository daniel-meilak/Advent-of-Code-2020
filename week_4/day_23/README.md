## Day 23

For day 23 I attempted to use lists to see if they would fix the problems I saw with needing to add and remove data from the container frequently. Unfortunately my list version seems to run slower regardless so I should probably stick to vectors until I understand them a little better. 

Part 2 completely dumbfounded me as I had no idea how to speed up the problem, so I had to look at the subreddit where one used conveniently explained what he was doing in the comments of his java code. I then proceeded to implement this in C++ and made several mistakes which caused me to take an extra hour or two to literally copy someone else's code!!!

Well at least now I understand very well whats going on and why exactly this solution works well.

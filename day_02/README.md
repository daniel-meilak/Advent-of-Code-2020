## Day 2

String manipulation! At this point I am curious about the capabilities of the std::regex library in C++ however for now I shall avoid using it and instead getting familiar with string manipulation using string.find() and string.substr(). Using various characters such as the '-' as an anchor it is not too difficult to parse the input as required. 

Finding the actual answer for each part is relatively trivial and only required a few comparisons to accomplish. Most of the work is in parsing and storing the input data.

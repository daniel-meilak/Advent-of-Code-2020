## Day 21

Overall quite nice puzzle. Something tells me this is the quiet before the storm. I ended up using unordered maps however I can't help but feel that my solution is terribly inefficient. Every step makes sense to me but I simply don't know it there was a simple and more elegant way of doing it.

Luckily I figured out pretty quickly what part 1 was leading to so I ended up essentially coding for the solution to part 2 immediately. It probably took more time to figure out how to do the maths for part 1, as I misread the question, than it did to actually do part 2 as I already had everything I needed.
